# World-Simulator

This is a simulation made in p5js to explore different artificial intelligence implementations. Eventually this will be running on a website so you can see it in action. The goal is to create a self-sustaining environment using genetic algorithms. Individual species are represented, but overall fitness is primarily dependent on the life of the entire system. 

This is a work in progress.
